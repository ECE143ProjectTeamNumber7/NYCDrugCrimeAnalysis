    "# NY Druc Crime Analysis\n",
    "#### Proposal\n",
    "As you are aware, drug-related crimes have been a persistent issue in urban areas,\n",
    "including New York City. Understanding the dynamics and patterns of these crimes can have\n",
    "significant implications for law enforcement and policymakers. Research in this field can\n",
    "provide insights into the underlying factors of drug-related crimes in NYC.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project proposal aims to explore the trends and patterns in drug crimes in NYC using\n",
    "available data that includes the precincts where these crimes occurred, the specific time of when\n",
    "they occured, when the crime was reported, descriptions and levels of offense, whether the\n",
    "crime was successfully completed, latitude-longitude coordinates, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we will investigate the correlation between the crimes and other factors, like\n",
    "geography, population, race, and compare the difference between districts. We aim to identify\n",
    "geographical hotspots and coldspots of drug-related crimes within NYC, using provided data that\n",
    "includes lat-lon coordinates. We will examine temporal patterns to understand when drug-related\n",
    "crimes are more likely to occur during the day, which can shed light on potential contributing\n",
    "factors. We intend to categorize drug-related offenses by type and severity, offering a deeper\n",
    "understanding of the nature of these crimes in the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project will involve data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data quality and\n",
    "accuracy. Multiple columns/features in the dataset have NaNs or ambiguous values (precinct #),\n",
    "and we will deal with this appropriately. We will use various data analysis techniques, including\n",
    "spatial analysis, time series analysis, and data visualization, to achieve the project’s objectives.\n",
